**A: AI Confidence Score Explained**

The **confidence** metric represents how certain the AI model is about its pricing recommendation.

**What it measures:**
- **Confidence Percentage (0-100%)**: How sure the AI is that its pricing recommendation will achieve the predicted results
- **Higher confidence** = More reliable prediction
- **Lower confidence** = More uncertainty in the recommendation

**How it's calculated:**
The confidence score considers several factors:
1. **Data Quality**: How much historical data is available for this product/customer segment
2. **Market Stability**: How predictable the pricing patterns are
3. **Customer Behavior**: How consistent the customer segment's purchasing behavior is
4. **External Factors**: Market conditions, seasonality, competition

**Confidence Levels:**
- **90-100%**: Very high confidence - Strong data, clear patterns
- **80-89%**: High confidence - Good data, reliable patterns  
- **70-79%**: Moderate confidence - Adequate data, some uncertainty
- **60-69%**: Low confidence - Limited data, higher risk
- **Below 60%**: Very low confidence - Insufficient data, high uncertainty

**In your pricing engine:**
The confidence is calculated based on:
- Customer segment reliability
- Historical pricing performance
- Market volatility factors
- Data completeness

**How to use it:**
- **High confidence (85%+)**: Feel confident implementing the recommendation
- **Medium confidence (70-84%)**: Consider the recommendation but monitor results closely
- **Low confidence (<70%)**: Use with caution, consider additional market research
